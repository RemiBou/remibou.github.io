## About me

My name is RÃ©mi BOURGAREL. I am a Software Engineer / Architect living in Toulouse, France. 

For 11 years I worked with Microsoft technologies (ASPNET WebForm, .Net Framework, .Net Core, Azure, SQL Server, ...), since 2019 I am working on a different stack (Java / Angular, PostgreSQL, Debian). I am curious about everything related to software development and architecture and I love to find simpler / more efficient ways of doing stuff. 

On this blog I will focus on my experiment on different technologies that I learn on my free time (I got 2 kids, so don't expect a post per day :) ). My contact details are in the footer of every pages (linkedin, twitter, github ...).
