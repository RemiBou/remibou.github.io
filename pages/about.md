## About me

My name is RÃ©mi BOURGAREL. I am a Software Engineer / Architect living in Toulouse, France. 

I used to work with Microsoft tehcnologies (ASPNET WebForm, Framewrok now Core, Azure, SQL Server ...), but now I'm working with a very different stack (Java / Angular, PostgreSQL, Debian). I am very curious about everything related to software development and architecture.

On this blog I will focus on my experiment on different tehcnologies that I learn on my free time (I got one kid, so don't expect a post per day :) ). my contact details are in the footer of every pages (linkedin, twitter, github ...).
